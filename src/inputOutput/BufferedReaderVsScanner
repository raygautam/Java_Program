Following are the Major Differences between Scanner and BufferedReader Class in Java

-> BufferedReader is synchronous while Scanner is not.
    BufferedReader should be used if we are working with multiple threads.
-> BufferedReader has a significantly larger buffer memory than Scanner.
-> The Scanner has a little buffer (1KB char buffer) as opposed to the BufferedReader (8KB byte buffer), but itâ€™s more than enough.
-> BufferedReader is a bit faster as compared to Scanner because the Scanner does the parsing of input data and BufferedReader simply reads a sequence of characters.
