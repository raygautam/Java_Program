HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a client's request made through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). These status codes provide information about the outcome of the request and are grouped into various categories. Here are some common HTTP status codes along with their explanations:

1. Informational Responses (1xx):
   - 100 Continue: The server has received the initial part of the request and asks the client to continue sending the remainder.
   - 101 Switching Protocols: The server agrees to switch protocols as requested by the client.

2. Successful Responses (2xx):
   - 200 OK: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested content.
   - 201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.
   - 204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.

3. Redirection Messages (3xx):
   - 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location.
   - 302 Found: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location.
   - 304 Not Modified: The client's cached version of the requested resource is up to date.

4. Client Error Responses (4xx):
   - 400 Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed syntax).
   - 401 Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication.
   - 403 Forbidden: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
   - 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

5. Server Error Responses (5xx):
   - 500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message indicating that an unexpected condition was encountered by the server.
   - 503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unavailable, usually due to overload or maintenance.

These are just a few examples of HTTP status codes. There are many more, each indicating a specific condition or outcome of the request. HTTP status codes are crucial for understanding the result of an HTTP request and are used by both clients and servers to communicate information about the request and response.
